Feature: Maintaining Study Controlled Terminology Standard Versions in Clinical MDR API

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to ensure [Scenario], 
        So that I can effectively maintain and manage controlled terminology versions for study data standards.

    Scenario: User must be able to retrieve Study Data Standard Versions of Controlled Terminology via API
        When The Study Data Standard Versions of Controlled Terminology API endpoint is called
        Then The API should respond correctly with the Study Data Standard Versions of Controlled Terminology
